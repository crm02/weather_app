# weather_app that a free API from openweathermap.org. 
# To use the API you have to create an account with openweathermap, then:
# click on your profile name ---> My API Keys ----> Paste your API key into line 85 in main.py
# And wallah, the program should be usable and you should be able to see the weather and weather condition
# of any city. 

# FUTURE UPDATES-----------------------------------------------------------------
# Make city specific. Right now the API assumes the city off of some basis (likely city popularity)
# Small cities tend to share names so you can't differentiate between Middletown PA and Middletown XX
